# Minecraft menu re-creation

## This is my first personal project using JavaScript, in which I had two main aims:
- (1) learn how to fetch data from an API
- (2) consolidate my knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project I re-created the Minecraft menus from scratch, but instead of creating the usual buttons of 'Singleplayer' and 'Multiplayer', etc. I created lists of
items, foods, mobs, and biomes, which were being fetched from an API. I used two APIs containing all the necessary data and filtered that data accordingly into categories.

I learnt more through this project than I could have imagined, as different problems arose at different points in the project and forced me to find 
solutions which were often not obvious. I'm satisfied with how it turned out and I thoroughly enjoyed every part of this project!
